## 🛠️ Development

This project is built using:

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Chrome Extensions APIs
- Manifest v3

> **Key files:**
- `service_worker.js` – background service worker
- `content.js` – logic injected into YouTube pages
- `popup.html` – minimal UI interface (if needed)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

CtrlTube evaluates YouTube thumbnails, titles, and metadata using predefined rules and keyword filters. Videos deemed distracting are automatically hidden or removed from the page.

> **Planned:** AI-based detection using Gemini API (coming soon).
